### Goal: Execute a script remotely using this very repository ###

I intend on writing a simple bash code, and using one of my virtual machines to grab the script using the "git" command
this is going to be something incredibly simple. A print within the terminal box saying, "Hello World." There is no need for 
an exclamation point, it isnt that impressive.
